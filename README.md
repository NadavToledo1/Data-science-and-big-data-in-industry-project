# Data science and big data in industry project
Our project focuses on improving early detection of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, using AI-driven image analysis.


We used a rich dataset provided by ISIC, including 3D body scans, dermoscopic images, and detailed metadata.


By combining this visual and contextual information, we developed a multimodal deep neural network designed to support clinicians in identifying malignant skin lesions more accurately and efficiently.


The goal is not to replace doctors, but to provide a decision support tool that can help reduce diagnostic delays, minimize unnecessary biopsies, and ultimately save lives through earlier detection.
